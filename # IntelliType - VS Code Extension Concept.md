# IntelliType - VS Code Extension Concept

## 🎯 Overview

**IntelliType** is a VS Code extension designed to solve one of TypeScript developers' most common pain points: finding and applying the right types and interfaces for untyped objects in large codebases.

## 🚀 Core Problem

When working with TypeScript in large projects, developers often:
- Create objects without knowing that matching types already exist
- Spend significant time searching through files to find the right interface
- Miss opportunities to reuse existing types, leading to code duplication
- Struggle to maintain type consistency across the codebase

## 💡 Solution

IntelliType provides intelligent type suggestions by analyzing untyped objects and matching them against existing types and interfaces in the codebase.

```

## 🔧 Core Features

### 1. Smart Object Analysis
- Continuously scans TypeScript files for untyped variables and objects
- Analyzes object shapes and property structures
- Identifies candidates that could benefit from explicit typing

### 2. Visual Type Indicators
- Shows subtle squiggly underlines beneath untyped objects that have potential matches
- Non-intrusive visual cues that don't clutter the editor
- Integrates seamlessly with VS Code's existing diagnostic system

### 3. Interactive Type Discovery
- **Hover Interaction**: Hover over underlined objects to see available actions
- **"Show Compatible Types" Option**: Click to view matching types
- **Native VS Code UX**: Follows established VS Code interaction patterns

### 4. Intelligent Type Matching
- **Shape Analysis**: Compares object properties with existing interfaces
- **Compatibility Scoring**: Ranks matches by compatibility percentage
- **Property Matching**: Considers property names, types, and optionality
- **Inheritance Awareness**: Understands type hierarchies and extensions

### 5. One-Click Type Application
- **Instant Application**: Click a suggested type to apply it immediately
- **Auto-Import**: Automatically adds necessary import statements
- **Smart Positioning**: Places imports in the appropriate location
- **Undo Support**: Full undo/redo integration
